		<h3 id="directions">Directions: </h3>

		<p>Based on your needfinding, identify at least two needs you could address with your chat app. Then, for each,
			generate at least two ideas for how you could address these needs, ideally a lot more (remember: quantity
			over quality!). For each, create sketches to illustrate your ideas (these will also be useful in HW7 when
			you do paper prototyping), and accompanying text describing the need, the proposed solution, and why you
			think it will work.</p>
		<p>The ideas you present should not be tiny ("use a better font for improved readability"). Also, since you will
			ultimately be aiming to implement these ideas, they should not be too large ("an online discussion and
			voting system for state government budgeting"). Instead, you should think on the scale of adding features to
			what is still at its core a traditional messaging application. These added features are may only partially
			address the need you've identified. You are encouraged to confer with LAs regarding the scope of your ideas
			before you flesh them out.</p>
		<p>Deliverable: For addressing at least two distinct needs, at least two substantially different candidate designs
			presented via sketches showing (UIs for) them (hand drawn is fine), each with an accompanying textual
			explanations of the need(s) it aims to address, how it aims to address it, and why you think it might work.
