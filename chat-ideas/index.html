			<ol>
				<ul>
					<li>Facebook Messenger was the most popular app amongst my group of participants, so even though it
						was one
						one participant's favorite app, it was still highly preffered throughout the rest of the
						participants generally speaking.</li>
					<li>All participants described replying to messages to be a problem, either with showing some sort
						of agreement with the text or actually bringing themselves to answer.</li>
					<li>There's no centralized form of texting, as in there's a different app for texting different
						people. E.g Slack for professional matters and iMessage for personal matters. It can also be
						assumed there's a lot of user frustration in the midsts of so many messaging apps and having to
						keep up with downloading and signing up for the apps.</li>
					<li>Being able to easily add new people to text is a crucial part of the preffered apps. Messenger
						was preffered because of how easy it is to find someone by typing their first and last name.
					</li>
					<li>Very niche apps can develop into more widely used apps. For example, Discord was originally a
						gamer's app, but nowadays is being used for hackathons, classrooms, and non-gamer related chats.
						Scaleability is crucial to the success of an app. Making it such that every type of user can
						begin to use it will indubitably grow the app's popularity. When creating an app, its important
						to survey a diverse group of participants, and so this small-scale interview needs to be
						conceptualized within the population surveyed; all three of whom were MIT students.</li>
